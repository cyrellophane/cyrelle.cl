    About this site
  </h1>
  <p>
    I've recently been exploring various skills and concepts on the periphery of my Visual Design experience. Some of these include front end coding, UX Design, and mobile-first and responsive web design. I wanted to make a project where I could use and
    build upon this new knowledge. This porfolio is the culmination of that process.

      1. Wireframing in Sketch
    </h2>
    <p>
      We created a fun "Shark Party" content page as a way to drive traffic to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project started when the copywriter came to me with her concept and inspiration. Together we drafted a creative brief, which I then developed into a high-fidelity comp. I provided creative guidance to the photographer and we worked together to
      make sure the resulting photographs worked for each placement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once our team was happy with the design, I worked with the client to finalize it. I handed off web-ready assets and design specs to our front-end team, and performed a design review of the coded site. From there I extended the design to all marketing
      assets that would drive viewers to the page.
