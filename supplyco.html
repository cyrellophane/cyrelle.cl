    1791 is a clothing line focusing on quality clothes made in the USA. For their
    new retail site, I expanded upon their existing brand identity to create a clean, modern, authentic
    design. I designed all site comps, assets, and promotional creative.

      I worked with the client and Director of Content to define marketing
      goals and resolve content placement on the homepage. I typeset the site
      in Trade Gothic, Sentinel and Gotham, and developed a faded photography
      treatment to create a feeling of modern Americana.
