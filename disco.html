    Discovery Channel Shark Week
  </h1>
  <p>
    Shark Week is Discovery Channel's biggest event of the year and in 2016 we developed the biggest marketing event in the store's history. From concept to completion, I spearheaded the project with a copywriter and delivered on tight deadlines.

      Discovery Channel 2016 Shark Week was one of the most complex projects I worked on while I was a designer at Delivery Agent. It centered around four conceptual content pages with various supporting marketing pieces for different platforms and
      placements. In the end over 80 different pieces were created.

    <p>
      We created a fun "Shark Party" content page as a way to drive traffic to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project started when the copywriter came to me with her concept and
      inspiration. Together we drafted a creative brief, which I then developed
      into a high-fidelity comp. I provided creative guidance to the photographer
      and we worked together to make sure the resulting photographs worked
      for each placement.

    <p>
      Once our team was happy with the design, I worked with the client to
      finalize it. I handed off web-ready assets and design specs to our front-end
      team, and performed a design review of the coded site. From there I extended
      the design to all marketing assets that would drive viewers to the page.

        Working with the marketing team, I designed several multi-channel
        campaigns that supported our big push for Shark Week 2016,
        including the following examples.
