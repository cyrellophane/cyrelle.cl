    Discovery Channel Shark Week

  <p>
    Shark Week is Discovery Channel's biggest event of the year and in 2016 we developed
    the biggest marketing event in the store's history. I co-managed the project with our
    copywriter, and made sure everything looked perfect From concept to finished product,
    delivering on extremely tight deadlines.

      Discovery Channel 2016 Shark Week was one of the most complex
      projects I worked on while I was a designer at Delivery Agent.
      It centered around four conceptual content pages with various supporting
      marketing pieces for different platforms and placements, for which I was
      responsible for all design. In the end I created over 80 different assets.

      Host a Fin-tastic Shindig
    </h2>
    <p>
      We created a fun "Shark Party" content page as a way to drive traffic to the site.
    </p>
    <p>
      This project started when the copywriter came to me with her concept and inspiration. Together we drafted a creative brief, which I then developed into a high-fidelity comp. I provided creative guidance to the photographer and we worked together to
      make sure the resulting photographs worked for each placement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once our team was happy with the design, I worked with the client to finalize it. I handed off web-ready assets and design specs to our front-end team, and performed a design review of the coded site. From there I extended the design to all marketing
      assets that would drive viewers to the page.
